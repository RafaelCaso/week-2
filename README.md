# week-2
this is the official guideline for week 2 of $hackathon

your mission is to create a cluster of ai agents. they can be N, but N needs to be bigger or equal to three

you don't need any fancy setup. only an mvp. the collective mission of those agents is to coordinate to choose their pick for the winner of this week

this week being week 2

so the mission of the agents is to judge themselves to understand who is the better one

and that better one will be the one that we will use as the algorithm that will choose the bot's pick for the winner of this week

using as the information the github repo that you will use to develop this project, open source[1]

that repo needs to be a fork of this one

but that being done on thursday 16 of january at 23:59 UTC
