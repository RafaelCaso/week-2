# week-2
this is the official guideline for week 2 of $hackathon

your mission is to create a cluster of ai agents. they can be N, but N needs to be bigger or equal to three

you don't need any fancy setup. only an mvp. the collective mission of those agents is to coordinate to choose their pick for the 8 finalists of this week

this week being week 2

so the mission of the agents is to judge themselves to understand who are the 8 better pieces of code for that specific task:

choosing the 8 best projects of this week

and those 8 better ones one will be the one that we will use as the algorithm that all of the holders of $hackathon will vote for on the voting period

starting next thursday 23 at 23:59 UTC

to develop this project and for it to be valid for $hackathon week-2, it needs to be open source[1]

and that repo needs to be a fork of this one (the one where you are reading these words)

(https://github.com/weeklyhackathon/week-2)[https://github.com/weeklyhackathon/week-2]

but that being done on thursday 16 of january at 23:59 UTC
