# 🤖 Weekly Hackathon: Week Two

This is the official instructions repository for Week Two of $hackathon. 

Your mission is to build a cluster of AI agents that can collectively judge and select the best hackathon projects.

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

Create a system of three or more AI agents that work together to evaluate and select the top 8 finalists from the weekly hackathon submissions. These agents should coordinate and communicate with each other to make informed decisions about project quality and potential.

The winning algorithm will be used by all $hackathon holders to vote during the official voting period.
