# AI Agent Evaluation System

## 🤖 Agent Methodology

The evaluation system employs 3 agents that each have a specific area of expertise. These agents are then managed by a 4th, coordinator agent, that facilitates discussion and creates a consensus. This design ensures comprehensive project evaluation across technical, creative, and ecosystem dimensions while maintaining balanced and well-reasoned assessments. All agents have been designed to be encouraging and never disparaging. They are honest and direct, but these aspects of their personality may need to be adjusted if honest feedback suffers as a result.

## 📊 Evaluation Process

1. **Individual Assessments**

   - Each agent independently evaluates projects within their domain expertise
   - Agents provide scores from 0 to 100 as well as giving detailed feedback
   - Feedback includes specific strengths and areas for improvement

2. **Consensus Building**

   - Coordinator facilitates discussion between agents
   - Analyzes individual evaluations for patterns
   - Identifies key points of agreement and conflict
   - Guides towards balanced consensus

3. **Final Scoring**
   - Synthesizes perspectives into unified assessment
   - Generates consensus score
   - Provides detailed reasoning for final score
   - Lists unified strengths and improvement areas
   - Ranks projects based on consensus scores

## 💯 Scoring Criteria

Each agent evaluates projects on a 0-100 scale within their expertise:
